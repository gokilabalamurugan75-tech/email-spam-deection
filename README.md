# Email Spam Detection using Python and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an Email Spam Detection system using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The main objective is to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) by applying text preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms.

This project was developed as part of my final year academic project and also reflects my practical learning in Python and Machine Learning.

## 📂 Project Files Description
- email-data.csv – Dataset used for training and testing
- train-model.py – Script to train the machine learning model
- spam-detector.py – Main spam detection logic
- spam_gui.py – Graphical User Interface for user interaction
- model.pkl – Trained machine learning model
- vectorizer.pkl – Text vectorizer used for feature extraction
- README.md – Project documentation

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Email text is preprocessed (lowercase, stopword removal, tokenization)
2. Text is converted into numerical features using vectorization
3. A supervised machine learning algorithm is trained
4. The trained model predicts whether an email is spam or not
5. A GUI allows users to test email messages easily
